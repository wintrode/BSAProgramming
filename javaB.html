        <p>Java is a language very similar to C++ that was designed to be easy to run on different types
          of computers.  Java is both compiled and interpreted.  You compile your Java code to what is called
        <code>bytecode</code>.  The bytecode is <i>machine-independent</i>, which means it is not actual
         machine instructions, like for a PC processor - the intel x86 or a phone processor - the ARM.  Java needs
       another program, which is written in machine code, the Java interpreter, to run Java bytecode.  Confusing?  It is.  </p>

           <p> Like C/C++ the basic way of writing Java programs is using a <code>text editor</code>.  You write your program code,
             compile the code file, run the compiled program, see what happens, then write some more code, and repeat.</p>

          <p> Using the <a href="JAVA/hello.java">Hello World</a> program, you will need a <code>command line</code> window.  Like DOS or
            <code>cmd</code> in Windows, this lets you type commands (programs) and run them, instead of clicking on icons. </p>

            <p> To compile C/C++ programs you use a program called <code>javac</code> - the <b>JAva</b> <b>c</b>ompiler.
              The following commands compile the program in hello.cc and then run it. </p>

<pre>
  javac -cp JAVA JAVA/bsa/hello.java
  java -cp JAVA bsa.hello
</pre>

           <p>In C/C++, re-usable code lives in <code>libraries</code>  like modules in python.
             There are <code>libraries</code> for math, and text, and music, and images, and lots of other things.
             The best way to learn is to look at examples. </p>
